# Simple_Entropy
Very simple program that returns the theoretical (max) entropy, the real entropy and the redundancy rate. Plus a character counter.





## Output Example

```bash
Character Count :
a = 4
b = 4
c = 0
d = 0
e = 0
f = 0
g = 0
h = 0
i = 0
j = 0
k = 0
l = 0
m = 0
n = 0
o = 0
p = 0
q = 0
r = 0
s = 0
t = 0
u = 0
v = 0
w = 2
x = 0
y = 0
z = 0
Char Total : 10 char
Source entropy: 1.521928
Maximum entropy: 1.584962
Redundancy rate: 0.041417
```
